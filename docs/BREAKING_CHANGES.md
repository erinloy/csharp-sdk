# Breaking Changes Assessment

## Summary
**No breaking changes** - All modifications are purely additive.

## API Compatibility Analysis

### Existing Interfaces
✅ `IMcpClient` - Only additions, no modifications to existing members
✅ `IMcpEndpoint` - Unchanged
✅ `ITransport` - Only added optional `IsAlive` property with default implementation

### Existing Classes
✅ `McpClient` - Only additions, no changes to existing behavior
✅ `McpClientFactory` - Unchanged
✅ `TransportBase` - Added virtual property with default implementation
✅ All transport implementations - Only additions

### Binary Compatibility
- No changes to existing method signatures
- No changes to existing property types
- No removal of public members
- No changes to inheritance hierarchy

### Source Compatibility
- No required changes to existing code
- All new features are opt-in via event subscriptions
- Default behavior remains unchanged

### Behavioral Compatibility
- Connection establishment process unchanged
- Message sending/receiving unchanged
- Error handling unchanged (errors still thrown as before)
- Disposal behavior unchanged

## Migration Impact

### For Existing Applications
**No action required** - Existing applications will continue to work without any modifications.

### For Applications Wanting New Features
Simply subscribe to the new events:

```csharp
// Before (still works)
var client = await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(transport);
await client.SendRequestAsync(...);

// After (opt-in to new features)
var client = await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(transport);
client.Connected += OnConnected;
client.Disconnected += OnDisconnected;
await client.SendRequestAsync(...);
```

## Version Compatibility
- Minimum supported .NET version: Unchanged
- Package dependencies: Unchanged
- Can be safely adopted in minor version update (e.g., 1.1.0 → 1.2.0)
