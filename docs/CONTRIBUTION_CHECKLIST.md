  - Shows reconnection patterns
  - Includes both STDIO and HTTP examples

### Documentation
- [x] **API Documentation**
  - XML comments on all public members

  - Architecture overview
  - Best practices guide
  - Common patterns documented
  - Troubleshooting section

  - Pattern examples
  - Gradual adoption strategy

### Compatibility
- [x] **Backward Compatibility**
  - No breaking changes
  - All additions are opt-in
  - Existing tests still pass

- [x] **Transport Compatibility**
  - Works with all transport types
  - Proper abstraction maintained
  - Transport-specific features documented

## Review Readiness

### Architecture
- [x] Leverages existing infrastructure (`MessageProcessingTask`)
- [x] No unnecessary complexity added
- [x] Follows SOLID principles
- [x] Maintains separation of concerns

### Error Handling
- [x] Graceful degradation when events fail
- [x] Proper exception information in `DisconnectedEventArgs`
- [x] No exceptions thrown from event handlers affect connection

### Logging
- [x] Appropriate log levels (Info for connection, Warning for unexpected disconnect)
- [x] No sensitive data in logs
- [x] Structured logging with proper parameters
- [x] Follows upstream LoggerMessage patterns

## Upstream Integration Notes

### Why This Feature?
1. **Community Need**: Multiple requests for connection management
2. **Production Readiness**: Essential for real-world applications
3. **Zero Impact**: Completely opt-in, no breaking changes
4. **Best Practices**: Enables proper error handling and recovery

### Design Decisions
1. **Reuse MessageProcessingTask**: No additional threads needed
2. **Event-Based**: Follows .NET conventions
3. **Transport Agnostic**: Works with all transport types
4. **Minimal Surface Area**: Only essential APIs added

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. ❌ Polling-based monitoring - Too resource intensive
2. ❌ Callback-based API - Less idiomatic for .NET
3. ❌ Separate monitoring service - Too complex
4. ✅ Event-based with MessageProcessingTask - Simple and efficient

## Post-Merge Support

- Ready to address feedback promptly
- Can provide additional examples if needed
- Available for documentation updates
- Will monitor for any issues post-release
